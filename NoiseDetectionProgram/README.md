**To run this this script you must hava Python_3.7.6 installed on your system. The script uses Python third-party libraries pandas, numpy, sklearn and cleanlabp.**

# Program execution instruction:
e.g.  
python RQ2_SCVND/main_CL_vs_NEAT.py  
python RQ2_SCVND/main_RF_vs_NEAT.py  

RQ2_SCVND/main_CL_vs_NEAT.py is the Python running script corresponding to the CL (Confident Learning) baseline and the NEAT approach under RQ2 (the SCVND scenario), and contains necessary code comments inside the code.  

Before running this script, there are two points to note:  
1. You need to replace the absolute path in the code with the path you use.  
2. You need to install the third-party libraries required by the program, including but not limited to pandas, numpy, sklearn and cleanlabp [1].
